# Home Services Platform - Updated High Level Design

## 1. System Overview

The platform connects property owners in Sydney (with focus on Chinese-speaking community) with service providers including plumbers, electricians, home cleaners, and handymen. The system follows a social media-like workflow where customers can post service requests and service providers can bid on jobs or advertise their services.
